# Android Application Development

## Description
**The purpose of the application is to match users with restaurants according to their dietary preferences.** _This project was partially inspired by [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/)._ 

Although the application can be used by all, it specifically **targets foreigners/expats** and focuses on restaurants in the **region of Asia/Southeast Asia.** 

_The purpose was to minimize language barrier, and provide adequate restaurant information based on dietary needs and preferences._ 

This project was done with the help/supervision of [Altug Tanaltay](https://tr.linkedin.com/in/altug-tanaltay-590854a). 

## Frameworks & Tools Used
### Back-end

For the server side, I used **Spring Boot** to develop **RESTful Web Service**, along with other open-source APIs including JPARepository. Although the backend services was initially developed in a monolithic form, it is currently being changed to a microservice architecture. [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) is an open source Java-based framework, and is often used to create stand-alone applications/micro-services.

### Front-end 
For the graphical user-interface(GUI) development, **Android Studio SDK** was used for design and implementation, and the AVD Emulator for emulation.
